ML and CV(computer vision) are sub-fields of AI

CV deals with how the computer can gain high level of understanding of digital images
Technologies that use CV include self-driving cars(used as camera for object detection).
instagram, and other apps that offers the enhacement image processing.

!. How computer see images:
-computer see images as a set of pixels.
-pixels are number
- colours available in CV- it uses RGB

Kernel and Convolution
-kernel is same as matrix(table of numbers);
-convolution is a math operation(slide kernel on the image inorder to modify it




AI- Allows machines to simulate Human Behaviour;

ML - Allows a machine to learn from Data.
ML is a subcategory in AI.
