ML and CV(computer vision) are sub-fields of AI

CV deals with how the computer can gain high level of understanding of digital images
Technologies that use CV include self-driving cars(used as camera for object detection).
instagram, and other apps that offers the enhacement image processing.

!. How computer see images:
-computer see images as a set of pixels.
-pixels are number
- colours available in CV- it uses RGB

Kernel and Convolution
-kernel is same as matrix(table of numbers);
-convolution is a math operation(slide kernel on the image inorder to modify it


Webots is an open source and multi-platform desktop application used to simulate robots. It provides a complete development environment to model, program and simulate robots.

Main features:

Fast Prototyping

Wide variety of simulations (two-wheeled, industrial arms, drones, underwater vehicles, bipeds, ...)

Realistic physics engine (ODE)

Great documentation

Quality (peer reviewed code submissions)

It has been designed for a professional use, and it is widely used in industry, education and research. Cyberbotics Ltd. maintains Webots as its main product continuously since 1998.




AI- Allows machines to simulate Human Behaviour;

ML - Allows a machine to learn from Data.
